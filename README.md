# Raytracer in Rust

![Rendered Image](./rendered.png)

This is a simple raytracer written in Rust. I'm by no means a Rust expert. This project's aim was to
write a very simple raytracer to learn more about the Rust language.

See my [Pathtracer](https://github.com/NHollmann/Pathtracer) for a more stable and feature-rich Raytracer.
